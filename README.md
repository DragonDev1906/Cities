# Cities - Website
This project will allow anyone to buy a digital representation of a real-world city as an ERC-721 token. The city will passively produce ERC-20 coins that can be used to upgrade cities or buy new cities. Owning neighbors of a city increases the passive income. Holding a bigger city for a long time will allow you to claim an achievement ERC-721 token that is bound to your address but can be freely traded or sold on OpenSea.
